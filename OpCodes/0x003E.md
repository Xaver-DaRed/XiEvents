# OpCode: 0x003E

| Information               | Notes |
|---                        |---    |
| **OpCode**                | `3E ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??` |
| **OpCode Size**           | `7`   |
| **Sets `RetFlag`?**       | `No`  |
| **Sets `ExecPointer`?**   | `Yes` |

## Description

Tests if a bit is set. Adjusts the `ExecPointer` based on the state of the flag. 

This operates like an `if` statement. If the flag is set, then the `ExecPointer` is adjusted by 7 and the true condition is executed. If it is not set, then the `ExecPointer` is adjusted by a given amount to move past the true condition code.

## Pseudo Code

```cpp
void __thiscall FUNC_XiEvent_OpCode_0x003E(xievent_t* this)
{
    const auto val = FUNC_XiEvent_getworkofs_(this, 3);

    if ((FUNC_XiEvent_getworkofs(this, 1, val >> 5) & (1 << (val & 0x1F))) != 0)
        this->ExecPointer += 7;
    else
    {
        this->ExecPointer = FUNC_XiEvent_eventgetcode(this, 5);
    }
}
```
