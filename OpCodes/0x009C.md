## Description

Stores the client language id.

The way this function operates is kind of dumb. The client was updated to prevent old language versions from working and instead defaults itself to Japanese or English. For a short period, it also supported two European translations but those were discontinued. Instead, the client defaults to English now if those are selected.

  * `0` - Japanese - _(Handler will return: 1)_
  * `1` - English - _(Handler will return: 2)_
  * `2` - European (French) - _(Handler will return: 2)_
  * `3` - European (Deutsch) - _(Handler will return: 2)_

_All other results will return 1. `PTR_ValueUnknown` has never been observed to be anything other than `128` which is -1 as it's signed. This is static inside of FFXiMain.dll_

## Pseudo Code

```cpp
void __thiscall FUNC_XiEvent_OpCode_0x009C(xievent_t* this)
{
    auto val = PTR_g_papp->lang_kind;
    if (PTR_g_papp->unknown_flag < 0 && (val == 2 || val == 3))
        val = 1;

    if (val - 1)
    {
        if (val - 2)
        {
            if ((val - 2) == 1)
                FUNC_XiEvent_setworkofs_(this, 1, 4);
            else
                FUNC_XiEvent_setworkofs_(this, 1, 1);
        }
        else
        {
            FUNC_XiEvent_setworkofs_(this, 1, 3);
        }
    }
    else
    {
        FUNC_XiEvent_setworkofs_(this, 1, 2);
    }

    this->ExecPointer += 3;
}
```
